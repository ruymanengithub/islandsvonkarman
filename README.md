Simulation of Karman vortex streets behind the Canary Islands

This software is a modification of the original code by Matthias MÃ¼ller - Ten Minute Physics, of
which the original license and copyright notice is included in the main html file. 

Here is the simulator:

The following is an image from Sentinel 3, taken on 19 April 2021. Here you can see the "von Karman vortex streets" that form behind the islands, as they interrupt the flow from the NE trade winds. This is what inspired me to take the great code from Matthias Muller and modify it to change circular obstacle by polygons with the shape of (my beloved, and home) islands.

And here you can see a simulation result that has quite some resemblance to the real deal. Not bad for a 2D simulation running on your browser!
